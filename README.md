# Ohmyfood | Online Food Ordering :plate_with_cutlery:

This is the **third** project of the web developer program from OpenClassrooms.

Ohmyfood is a website allowing the users to **compose their own menu** before going to the restaurant. With this concept the waiting time at the restaurant will be reduced because the clients make their choice in advance.

Aim of the project was to turn mockups into webpages and to create **animations** and **transitions**. Mockups for the Ohmyfood website were provided for mobile, as well as logo and images. 

In addition to building the site using **HTML** and **CSS/SCSS**, it was required to create **animations** and **transitions** using **CSS**. The effects were provided in form of a short video. In order to make the website **fully-responsive**, suitable breakpoints were determined and adaptations were made for **tablet** and **desktop** layouts.
